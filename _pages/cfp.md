We welcome researchers working in the field of time series analysis to submit their latest original research work to the NeurIPS 2024 workshop on **Time Series in the Age of Large Models**.

## Key Information

- Submission link: **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/TSALM)**
- Submission deadline: Sep 15, 2024 (11:59 pm AoE)
- Acceptance notification: Oct 09, 2024
- Camera ready deadline: Nov 25, 2024

## Submission Instructions

Submissions should take the form of a short paper of up to **4 pages**. Additional pages containing references and appendices are allowed but the reviewers are _not obliged_ to refer to the appendices when reviewing the paper. Submissions should be made on **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/TSALM)** in a single `.pdf` file using **[this LaTeX style template](../assets/latex/timeseries-workshop-latex-template.zip)**. The review process in _double-blind_, so please ensure that your submission is properly anonymized. Papers that exceed the page limit or have not been properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review. Please note that there is no rebuttal phase and the final decisions will be made based solely on the submission and the reviews. Rejected and withdrawn submissions will not be made public.

All accepted submissions will be accompanied by a poster presentation. A number of selected submissions will be invited for lightning and oral talks. 

**Dual submission policy**: This workshop is **non-archival**; even though all accepted papers will be available on OpenReview and this website, there are no formally-published proceedings. If a paper is currently under review at another venue, it can still be submitted to this workshop. If a paper has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference, it should be reasonably extended in order to be accepted at this workshop. Parallel submission of papers under review at NeurIPS 2024 is allowed.

## Scope and Topics

We invite submissions related to the theme of time series in the age of large models. Key topics include, but are not limited to:

- **Building Time Series Foundation Models**: The heterogeneity of time series data and tasks presents unique challenges in developing time series foundation models. We welcome contributions exploring various design choices and improving our understanding of how these models scale with the amount and diversity of data.
- **Analysis of Pretrained Time Series Models**: Pretrained time series models are often criticized for their black-box nature, especially compared to interpretable statistical models. We encourage submissions that analyze pretrained time series models to enhance our understanding of their learning processes.
- **Critiques on Time Series Foundation Models**: Contributions highlighting the limitations and failure modes of time series foundation models through theoretical analysis or systematic empirical evaluations are welcome.
- **Faster and Better Inference Schemes for Autoregressive Time Series Models**: Single-step autoregressive time series foundation models are generally slower than multi-step models, such as those based on patching. We invite submissions comparing these techniques and developing methods to improve the inference speed and quality of autoregressive time series models.
- **Leveraging Pretrained Models of Other Modalities for Time Series**: Recent studies show promise in adapting pretrained LLMs to specialized time series tasks. We seek to understand how design choices in leveraging these models—such as prompting techniques, adaptation methods, and fine-tuning—impact performance. We also seek to identify scenarios where these methods excel compared to training time series foundation models from scratch, in terms of model capabilities, accuracy, and training and inference times.
- **Multimodal Time Series Models**: Most time series models handle only numerical data, often providing a partial picture of the system of interest. In real-world settings, multiple modalities are available, and incorporating exogenous information, such as text, can enhance performance. We invite submissions exploring time series models that integrate information from other modalities.
- **Large-Scale Time Series Datasets and Benchmarks**: The quality and quantity of publicly available time series data lag behind other modalities, such as text and vision. We welcome contributions of large-scale time series data (both general and domain-specific) and benchmarks comparing various time series foundation models. We also invite methods for better synthetic time series generation and augmentation to address data challenges.
- **Time Series Evaluation**: We seek contributions on the analysis, comparison, and development of metrics for time series tasks, including metrics for probabilistic forecasting, multivariate forecasting, and use-case motivated metrics.
- **Real-World Applications of Large Time Series Models**: We invite contributions showcasing the potential of large time series models in real-world domains, such as energy, healthcare, retail, human mobility, and finance.
